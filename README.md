# 📦 Quick-Commerce Operations Dashboard (Excel)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end exploratory analytics case study built entirely in Microsoft Excel, focused on analyzing quick-commerce operations such as revenue performance, order behavior, payment success, and customer experience.

Using Power Query, the Excel Data Model, Pivot Tables, and interactive dashboards, raw multi-table transactional data was transformed into actionable operational insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Clean and prepare multi-table transactional data using Power Query
* Build a structured Data Model with relationships
* Design meaningful business KPIs
* Perform exploratory analysis using Pivot Tables
* Create an interactive executive dashboard using Pivot Charts and slicers
* Derive actionable insights related to operations and customer experience

## 🎯 Business Objectives
* Understand overall revenue and order performance
* Identify key revenue drivers across product categories and regions
* Analyze order demand patterns by day and time
* Evaluate payment success rates across transaction modes
* Assess customer experience using rating distributions
* Design an executive-style operational dashboard in Excel


## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset simulates a quick-commerce platform with the following entities:
* Customers – customer demographics and location
* Orders – order date, quantity, coupons, delivery partner
* Products – product category, brand, pricing
* Transactions – payment mode and transaction status
* Ratings – product and delivery/service ratings
* Delivery Partners – delivery agent information

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
#### Performed using Power Query:
* cleaned and Standardized column names and data types
* Removed orphan and invalid records (e.g., ratings without orders)
#### Created derived fields:
* Order Day
* Monthly buckets
* Hourly divisions
* Validated relationships across tables
* Loaded clean tables into the Excel Data Model
#### Data Model
* Defined relationships across orders, products, customers, transactions, and ratings
* Enabled cross-table analysis using Pivot Tables and measures

## 📊 Key KPIs

The dashboard highlights the following core KPIs:
* Total Revenue (Net Order Value)
* Total Orders
* Average Order Value (AOV)
* Order Completion Rate

## 📈 Dashboard Analysis & Insights
#### 🔹 Revenue & Demand Trends
* Monthly revenue shows moderate variation across the available period
* Order volume is relatively stable across weekdays, with mid-week peaks
#### 🔹 Revenue Drivers
* Personal Care and Snacks categories show higher AOV
* Revenue is concentrated in a few key states, indicating regional demand clustering
#### 🔹 Payments & Operations
* Digital payment methods (UPI, Cards) show higher success rates than COD
* Payment mode selection impacts order completion
#### 🔹 Customer Experience
* Average ratings appear healthy, but distribution analysis shows a meaningful share of low ratings
* Rating distribution provides better insight than averages alone

## 📊 Dashboard Features

#### Interactive slicers for:
* Date (Year / Quarter / Month)
* State
* Hourly Division
#### Clean, executive-style layout using:
* Shape-based KPI cards
* Pivot Charts 
* Focused, non-redundant visuals

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query
* Data Model
* Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
* Measures using the Excel Data Model (DAX)
* Slicers & Timelines

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened my ability to:
* Perform structured data cleaning using Power Query
* Build relational data models in Excel
* Design meaningful KPIs for operational analysis
* Create interactive dashboards using Pivot Tables
* Translate exploratory analysis into business-relevant insights
